Easy to access AI assistant made by Patrick Yu.

BigBro is a chatbot app. that allows you to use LLM (Large Language Model) easily and quickly in your desktop. All of BigBro's features are available via keyboard shortcuts, so you can access it at any time while focusing on your job.

*Currently I only distribute executable binaries for Windows and macOS, but I plan to open the source code soon.*

## Multiple System Prompts

You can save multiple system prompts and change them at any time (`ctrl/cmd+[`, `ctrl/cmd+]`). Create chatbot friends by setting the persona you want.
